# VoyagerProject
Space Voyager text based console game, with choices
Minimum Viable Project aimed for:

Console-/text-based
Goal: Trade any goods/services between planets for profit
Compelling Story, including a "good ending"
Bad ending: 60 years old or assets with total value <= 0
Starting conditions: 18 year old character with a ship and goods or means to acquire a ship and goods
Minimum of 3 planets: Earth, Proxima Centauri 1 (use the actual distance to Proxima Centauri), and one other of your choosing
Distance/time relation based on Star Trek TNG warp equation (provided below)
2-D grid system with Earth as the origin
Value of goods vary per-planet
One universal currency
Minimum of 5 items of trade

**Everything in the list works except the Age doesn't add up for each planet (a bug to fix later) and The bartering system isn't complete.

The voyager console game is a text-based game, that allows the player to make one of two choices:Chance or Safe

Chance: The chance will allow the player to take a risky move, an random number generator will roll the "dice" with a 1 resulting in the 
worst luck, 2 resulting in bad luck, 3 is kinda bad luck, 4 is ok luck, 5 is good luck, and 6 is the best luck
"dice" roll 1 through 3 will result in the warp drive factor equating to 1.3 and 3,2, or 1 resources lost
"dice" roll 4 through 6 will result in the warp drive factor equating to 1.5 and 1,2, or 3 resources gained

Safe: the warp drive factor is set at 1.4, with no affect to resources. The safe route cannot be taken through every planet, doing so 
will result in age over 60.
